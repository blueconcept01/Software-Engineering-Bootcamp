In this Redshift exercise, we will access the AWS redshift service using python and boto3.

boto3 - Boto3 is the name of the Python SDK for AWS. It allows you to directly create, update, and delete AWS resources from your Python scripts.

Please refer the document 'doc_to_setup_programmatic_access_boto.docx' to setup boto3 and access credentials in python. After this document, you should have the
access key and secret key that we will be using to setup the connection between python and AWS redshift service.

We can use use boto3 to access AWS services.We will be implementing the following python files that will interact with redshift services in AWS -

1. redshift-create-cluster.py - this python file shows you how to create redshift cluster in AWS using python boto3.
This file will do the following:
- setup the session with the AWS credentials.
- connect to the redshift client
- Call the method "create_cluster" with the details - cluster name, node type, username, password, database name, and the port.
2. redshift-connect-to-cluster.py   - this python file shows you how to connect to redshift cluster in AWS using python boto3.
This file will do the following:
- Import psycopg2, this module is used to connect to redshift cluster, to query the database.
- Create connection with redshift service and get the details.
- Now, call the connect method on psycopg2, to setup the connection with the redshift database.
- The database is connected, you can call the command to perform the operations on the database.

3. redshift-list-cluster.py - this python file shows you how to list all the redshift clusters available in AWS using python boto3.
This file will do the following:
- setup the session with the AWS credentials.
- connect to the redshift client
- Call the "describe_clusters" method and get the name and related details for the clusters available.

4. redshift-delete-cluster.py - this python file shows you how to delete the redshift cluster in AWS using python boto3.
This file will do the following:
- setup the session with the AWS credentials.
- connect to the redshift client
- Call the "delete_cluster" method to delete the particular cluster.

I have added comments in the python files.
